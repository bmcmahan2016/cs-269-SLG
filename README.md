# cs-269-SLG
Com Sci 269 Subject Line Generation Project

# Files:
`BART_training.ipynb`: the notebook that train the BART model using training data
`t5_training.ipynb`: the notebook that train the T5 model using training data
`load_T5_model_and_generate_pred.ipynb`: the notebook to load the model generated by `t5_training` and generate subject lines on test set.(final generation is a csv file)
`load_BART_model_and_generate_pred.ipynb`: the notebook to load the model generated by `BART_training` and generate subject lines on test set.(final generation is a csv file)
`testing_csv_uploaded.ipynb` : the notebook to run ROUGE and METEOR on the result of `load_T5_model_and_generate_pred.ipynb` OR `load_BART_model_and_generate_pred.ipynb`
`train.csv`: the training set
`new_test.csv`: the test set


# process:
run one of the training notebooks and generate a model--> load the model into correspoding notebooks start with "load"--> test the csv file generated using`testing_csv_uploaded.ipynb`
